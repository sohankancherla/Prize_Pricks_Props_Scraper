# Prize_Pricks_Props_Scraper
A python script that automatically gets all of the Props on Prize Picks Sportsbook and displays the information into a csv. The script only gets the NBA props but can be changed to work for any sport.

# How to Run
python main.py

# Tools
- Selenium to use the chrome driver and create an automated software. I used this instead of Beautiful Soap because Prize Picks does not allow its site to be scraped
